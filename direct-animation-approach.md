# Direct Animation Control for Unchecking Tasks

## Problem
The previous implementation for unchecking tasks relied on `Animated.parallel` to manage animations, which caused timing issues and made it difficult to ensure proper z-index behavior during animation.

## Solution: Direct Animation Control

We've implemented a completely new approach to unchecking animations with these key improvements:

1. **Early State Update**
   - Update task completion state BEFORE starting animations
   - This ensures z-index is applied correctly throughout the animation

2. **Simplified Animation Flow**
   - Eliminated use of animation arrays and Animated.parallel
   - Direct animation control with individual start() calls
   - Each animation manages its own completion callback

3. **Increased Z-Index Contrast**
   - Increased z-index for unchecking tasks to 50 (from 25)
   - Increased elevation for Android devices to 10 (from 8)
   - This guarantees unchecked tasks stay in front during animation

4. **Consistent Opacity During Animation**
   - Maintain full opacity (1.0) for ANY animating task
   - Prevents fading issues during animation
   - Only apply reduced opacity (0.85) to completed tasks when not animating

5. **Synchronized Timing**
   - Added small delay (50ms) before starting animations
   - Ensures state updates have time to apply before animation begins
   - Coordinated timing between main task and supporting tasks

6. **Increased Duration**
   - Extended animation duration (500-600ms vs 450-500ms)
   - Two-step animation with 250ms + 350ms segments for bottom tasks
   - Allows for more noticeable and smooth movement

7. **Independent Reset Logic**
   - Each animation independently resets its values
   - Prevents state conflicts or animation interference
   - Better isolation of animation behavior

## Animation Flow

1. Update state immediately (task is marked as incomplete)
2. Short delay to allow state update to apply (50ms)
3. Start animation with position-aware timing and easing
4. Reset animation values in completion callback
5. Clear animating flag after completion

This direct control approach eliminates the problems from the previous implementation and provides a more reliable, visible animation when unchecking tasks.
