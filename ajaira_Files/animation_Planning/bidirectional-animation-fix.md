# ClassX Bidirectional Animation Fix

## Problem
The unchecking animation wasn't working correctly because of several issues:

1. Variable order problem - `duration` was being used before it was defined
2. Z-index handling wasn't properly differentiating between checking and unchecking
3. Animation calculations for reverse animation needed refinement
4. Task positioning logic needed clarification

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Variable Declaration Order
Corrected the order of variable declarations to ensure `duration` is defined before it's used.

### 2. Improved Z-Index Logic
```javascript
zIndex: animatingTaskId === task.id 
  ? (tasks.find(t => t.id === task.id).completed ? -1 : 20)  
  : (task.completed ? 0 : 10),
```
This dynamic z-index ensures:
- When checking: task has z-index -1 (behind other tasks)
- When unchecking: task has z-index 20 (in front of other tasks)
- When not animating: completed tasks are behind (0) and incomplete are in front (10)

### 3. Simplified Animation Logic
- Removed overly complex multi-step animation for unchecking
- Used direct calculation of move distance
- Added debugging logs to help track animation values

### 4. Clear Task Selection Logic
- Improved how we determine which tasks move when unchecking
- Better comments explaining the animation flow
- Fixed calculation of target position when unchecking

## Animation Flow for Unchecking

1. When user unchecks a task (e.g., task C):
   - C calculates its target position (after all incomplete tasks)
   - C animates upward with higher z-index to appear in front
   - Tasks between target position and current position (e.g., D, E) move downward

2. After animation completes:
   - State updates to mark task as incomplete
   - Task list re-renders with new order
   - All animation values reset to clean state

This implementation provides smooth bidirectional animations for both checking and unchecking tasks without any bounce effect.
