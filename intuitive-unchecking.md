# Intuitive Unchecking Animation Improvements

## Previous Issues
- Unchecking animations were bouncy and not as smooth as checking animations
- Visual cues were insufficient to show when a task was being unchecked
- Multi-step animations sometimes caused jitter or unexpected behavior

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Smoother Easing Function
- Replaced linear easing with a custom Bezier curve: `Easing.bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0)`
- This creates a more natural acceleration and deceleration
- Eliminates the robotic feel of linear easing while avoiding bounce

### 2. Simplified Animation Flow
- Removed complex multi-step animations that were causing bounce
- Used single timing animation with optimized duration (400ms)
- Eliminated unnecessary delays between animations

### 3. Enhanced Visual Feedback
- Added shadow effect to tasks being unchecked for better visibility
- Implemented a subtle highlight effect with lighter background
- Added a thin border around animating tasks for better distinction

### 4. Synchronized Movements
- All related animations now use identical durations (400ms)
- Better coordination between main task movement and supporting tasks
- No delays between different parts of the animation

### 5. Intelligent State Management
- State updates immediately before animation starts
- Task card styling changes instantly to provide immediate visual feedback
- Z-index priority ensures unchecked tasks always appear on top

## Animation Sequence
1. Task is marked as incomplete immediately
2. Task card styling changes to highlight the unchecking action
3. Smooth animation moves the task to its new position with no bounce
4. Supporting tasks shift positions seamlessly
5. All animations complete simultaneously

This implementation creates a more intuitive and visually pleasing unchecking animation that matches the quality of the checking animation.
