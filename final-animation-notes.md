# ClassX Task Animation Improvements

## Key Improvements for Smooth, Non-Bouncy Animations

### 1. Linear Easing
- Used `Easing.linear` explicitly for all animations to ensure constant velocity throughout
- Eliminated any acceleration/deceleration patterns that can cause bouncy effects
- Applied consistently to both the task being completed and tasks moving up

### 2. Animation Configurations
- Created a shared animation config object to ensure consistency between animations
- Used moderate duration (450ms) for all animations - fast enough to feel responsive but not too quick
- Enabled native driver for all animations for performance
- Used `stopTogether: true` to ensure animations complete simultaneously

### 3. Style Optimizations
- Used `backfaceVisibility: 'hidden'` to prevent rendering artifacts during animation
- Set proper z-index values to ensure completed tasks go behind other tasks during animation
- Set direct opacity values without animation to avoid timing issues
- Set elevation to 0 during animation (for Android) to prevent visual glitches

### 4. Animation Control Flow
- Reset animation values to their starting points before beginning any new animation
- Used `setValue()` directly for opacity changes instead of animating them
- Used `requestAnimationFrame()` for reset operations after animation
- Used consistent task height values rather than dynamic calculations

### 5. State Management
- Applied state updates only after all animations complete
- Updated the opacity of completed tasks even when not animating
- Maintained proper z-index ordering between completed and incomplete tasks

## Techniques to Prevent Bounce

1. **Linear Easing**: Used linear timing function instead of ease-in/ease-out or defaults
2. **Consistent Animation Durations**: Used the same duration for all animations in a set
3. **Direct Value Control**: Reset values using setValue() before animations start
4. **Parallel Animations**: Run animations in parallel rather than in sequence
5. **Animation Cleanup**: Properly reset all values after animations complete
6. **Fixed Measurements**: Used fixed task height rather than measuring dynamically

The result is a smooth animation where completed tasks slide behind other tasks to the bottom of the list, and tasks below simultaneous move up to fill the space, all without any bounce or spring effect.
