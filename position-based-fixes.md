# Position-Aware Animation Fixes

## Problem: Bounce Effect for Tasks Lower in the List

The animation system was experiencing bounce effects that worsened for tasks positioned lower in the list. Specifically:
- Task A (top): No bounce
- Task B: Slight bounce
- Task C: More noticeable bounce
- Task D (bottom): Severe bounce

## Solution: Position-Aware Animation Strategy

1. **Task Position Detection**:
   - Calculate each task's relative position in the list
   - Apply special handling for tasks at or near the bottom (last 2 positions)

2. **Multi-Step Animation for Bottom Tasks**:
   - Tasks near the bottom now use a two-step sequence animation
   - Move halfway with a slower timing first (225ms)
   - Complete the movement with a second animation (225ms)
   - This prevents the momentum build-up that was causing the bounce

3. **Duration Adjustments**:
   - Increased animation durations for bottom tasks (500ms vs 450ms)
   - Smoother, more controlled movement for longer distances

4. **Improved Animation Math**:
   - Calculate exact move distances based on tasks above and below
   - Precise positioning based on the task's current location in the list

5. **Transform Logic Refinement**:
   - Only apply transforms to the animating task and tasks below it
   - Prevent any unintended movements of tasks above the animating task

The result is a completely smooth animation experience regardless of task position in the list.
