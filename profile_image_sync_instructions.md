# Profile Image Sync Instructions

## Setting Up Profile Image Sync

Your ClassX app has been updated with enhanced profile image syncing capabilities to ensure your profile picture shows up consistently across devices.

### How Profile Syncing Works

1. When you upload a profile image:
   - The image is stored in Firebase Storage with a timestamp in the filename
   - The image URL (with cache control) is saved to your Firebase Auth profile
   - This ensures the latest version is always shown

2. When you log in on any device:
   - The app checks your Firebase Auth profile for the image URL
   - The app uses cache-breaking techniques to ensure the latest image is displayed
   - If no URL is found, it searches Firebase Storage for your most recent profile image

## Testing Profile Image Sync Across Devices

Follow these steps to ensure your profile syncs correctly:

1. **Prepare Your Firebase Environment**
   - Make sure the Firebase Storage security rules are properly set using the rules from `firebase_storage_rules.txt`
   - Verify that your Storage bucket name is correct in `firebaseConfig.js` (`classx-5b5dd.appspot.com`)

2. **On Your Primary Device**
   - Upload a profile image by tapping on the profile picture area
   - Verify the image appears and wait for the "Profile image updated successfully" alert
   - Use the "Test Storage" button to verify Firebase Storage is working correctly
   - Log out and log back in to verify the image persists

3. **On Your Secondary Device**
   - Log in with the same account credentials
   - If the image doesn't appear immediately, tap the "Sync Profile" button
   - Use the "Test Storage" button if you're still having issues

## Troubleshooting Sync Issues

If your profile image isn't syncing properly:

1. **Network Issues**
   - Ensure both devices have stable internet connections
   - Try connecting to a different network if possible

2. **Cache Problems**
   - Force a profile sync using the "Sync Profile" button
   - Log out and log back in to refresh the auth token
   - If needed, clear app cache (in device settings)

3. **Storage Issues**
   - Use the "Test Storage" button to verify Firebase storage connectivity
   - Check console logs for any error messages with "storage/" prefix
   - Verify Firebase Storage rules allow read/write to your user folder

4. **Auth Token Issues**
   - Log out completely and log back in to get a fresh token
   - On the problem device, try uploading a new profile image
   
## New Features

The updated profile syncing system includes:

- **Cache Control**: Prevents outdated images from appearing on different devices
- **Timestamped Filenames**: Ensures proper version tracking of profile images
- **Better Error Handling**: More detailed error messages help pinpoint issues
- **Diagnostic Tools**: The "Test Storage" button runs comprehensive diagnostics

If issues persist, check Firebase Console directly to verify your user profile settings and storage contents.
